# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


pseudocode

- A section to add general information like name, email and phone number.

- A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study and date of study)

- A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)

- to include an edit and submit button for each section or for the whole CV
    - The submit button should submit your form and display the value of your input fields in HTML elements.
    - The edit button should add back (display) the input fields, with the previously displayed information as values.
    - In those input fields, you should be able to edit and resubmit the content.

- Include a styles directory under your src directory for your CSS files.

- Push the results and deploy
